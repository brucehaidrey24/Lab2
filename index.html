            <p>It's Friday, April 9th and the weekend is finally here. My roommates are heading home for the night so 
                I invited one of my friends to hang out tonight. Before we get to the fun, I have <strong>A LOT</strong> of things to
                attend to. I spent the majority of last night scheduling emails to send to recruiters and applying to internships.
                Today I must finish up the last set of internships to apply to. On top of that, my homework for Math 20E is due 
                so that takes priority over the rest of the items on my list. After I finish those items, I'll read the prompt for 
                my lab for CSE 110 and begin thinking about its format. Now that I've finished everything I need to get done for today,
                it's time to look forward to the Night Life.

            <p>It's Saturday, April 10th and everyone knows that <strong>Saturdays are for the boys</strong>. My roommates are back so 
                we have plans to hang out tonight but before that, we have to take care of business. I start my day
                by responding to email responses I received from recruiters. After that's done, it's time to study up for my 
                algorithms and runtime quiz. Now that we've checked those two items off my list, we can begin Lab2 for CSE110. I'll work
                on this for a couple hours until the sun sets. After that, it's time for the boys to have their fun.

            <p>It's Sunday, April 11th and the weekend has come to an end. This is the day where I have to make sure I have 
                <em>everything</em> ready for the upcoming week. My lab is due along with a review quiz to test if I've been paying attention 
                during week 2 of classes. I also have an interview for a potential internship in the morning and need to
                prepare for that as well as do at least one problem on leetcode to enhance my skills. Lastly, my Math 170B 
                homework is due tomorrow and I need to, <em>at the minimum</em>, start that as well.

                    This weekend was very eventful. There were many assignments that needed to be completed and 
                    numerous fun activities to take part in. I had to, as they say, <em>work hard but party harder.</em>
                    I hate falling behind and the weekend is the perfect opportunity for me to catch up on lectures,
                    assignments, sleep, and fun. I was able to finish all of my assignments, plan meetings for the  
                    upcoming week, and enjoy my nights by hanging out with friends. Overall, it was a successful weekend.
